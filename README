This is a small program which will periodically update the prices of 
Bitcoin and other altcoins conversion rates in a google spreadsheet.
At this point the project pulls information from cryptsy and coinbase.


Installation:

There is one dependencies which need to be installed to interface with
google spreadsheets

1. Gdata client library for python https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/client-libraries

in ubuntu you can install these simply

1. apt-get install python-gdata

Thats it!

To Run the Program:

There are a few ways to use this program, but it is designed to be run as a daemon on linux.

cd cryptocoin_updater/

### Input

--c [start|stop] start or stop the daemon
--user [email address]
--s    [gdocs spreadsheet name]  create this file in google docs first
--currency [AltcoinBTC,AltcoinBTC,AltcoinLTC,etc..] Will get any coin exchange that is on cryptsy, no spaces.

### Simple: To run in a python shell

python crypto_sheet.py --c start --user [email address] --s [gdocs spreadsheet name] --currency [DGCBTC,DGCLTC,LTCBTC]


###ADVANCED  To run as a daemon 
to start the daemon:
python rundaemon.py --c start --user [email address] --s [gdocs spreadsheet name] --currency [DGCBTC,DGCLTC,LTCBTC]

to stop the daemom:  python rundaemon.py --c stop

by default the btcusd is added to the end. A log file is generated in /tmp/crypt_daemon.log
